• Review the code below and answer the following two questions:
1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call? 
3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?                                 
                                        
def increment_int_a(someval): 
	someval += 1
                                        
def increment_int_b(someval): 
	someval[0] += 1
                                        
def main(): 
	a = 32
        increment_int_a(a)
                                        
        b = [32]
        increment_int_b(b)


1. After the function call, increment_int_a doesn’t change the variable a. 
2. After the function call, increment_int_b changes the variable b into [33]. 
3. As for variable a, it doesn’t change since a is int type and it’s passing by value. And as for variable b, b is a list and it’s passing by reference, therefore it makes a change for variable b.
